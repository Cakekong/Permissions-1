Permissions... Done right.
Permissions allows plugin-authors to utilise a permission system that handles 
group inheritance, globalized permission settings, and more. All the features 
of a fine-grained permission system in one plugin.

This is a continuation of the work that was originally done by Nijikokun.  All
original credit goes to them as without their work this plugin would not have
been possible.

New Features
1. Multigroup (Yes, finally.)
2. In-game management commands.
3. SQL storage (optional)
4. Promotion/demotion tracks
5. Weightage.
6. World mirroring/inheritance.
7. Global Permissions.
And much more.
For more details on the features, read the first post in the forum thread.

AntiBuild functionality.
build: actually does something now within the config files. If you don't want a group to be able to build set it to build: false.
If a person is a member of multiple groups (inheritance) they will still be able to build unless all groups that they are inheriting 
and part of are set to build: false

For the admins
First thing that you will need to do is download the plugin. Place it in your plugins/ folder and unzip it. 
This should create the folder Permissions and a Permissions.jar file in your plugins folder. Next, go into Permissions/,
and create a folder named the same as your world. So if your world name from server.properties is Foo,
you will need to create a folder named Foo in plugins/Permissions/. After that, copy the provided groups.yml and users.yml
into that directory. You can then edit those two files. Help with editing/writing them can be found at
https://github.com/TheYeti/Permissions/wiki/Guide-to-creating-YAML-configs .

Permissions gives server admins great control, with ingame commands. For the complete listing of commands, visit

FAQ
[Q] I am getting an error that it can't pass BLOCK_PLACED or BLOCK _BREAK events to Permissions. Fix it!
[A] That's not a question. The reason why it can't place these is probably because the syntax of your Permissions file is all 
whacked out, or it is a different world and you don't have a config file 
for that world.

[Q] What am I suppose to name the config folder?
[A] You need to name it the same as your world. So if you look in server.properties at "level-name" you will see a world name 
there. Rename your config folder to the same thing as that.

[Q] Permissions are broken. Why can no one use commands? Why am I not an admin?
[A] First off, make sure that your formatting is correct. Look at the format that the default config file uses. Yours should 
look like that. Do NOT use tabs. Use 4 spaces (IE. " " <-- Four of those things.).

[Q] Which one am I suppose to download and unzip to install this?
[A] Download the main package, not the JAR only. Unzip the ZIP file. The JAR is simply there for people who are 
UPGRADING and do not need the default config files.

[Q] I have done all of this and this doesn't work! I'm going back to GroupManager!
[A] Well, there is probably the problem. Make sure that you delete EssentialsGroupManager.jar and EssentialsGroupBridge.jar as 
these don't play well with Permissions and will cause headaches.

[Q] When are you going to add <blah> <feature/command> into this already?
[A] Post a feature request on the GitHub issue tracker at https://github.com/TheYeti/Permissions/issues .
